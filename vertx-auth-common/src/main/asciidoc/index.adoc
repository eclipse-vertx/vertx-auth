= Common Authentication and Authorization

This Vert.x component provides interfaces for authentication and authorization that can be used from
your Vert.x applications and can be backed by different providers.

Vert.x auth is also used by vertx-web to handle its authentication and authorization.

To use this project, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-auth-common</artifactId>
  <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-auth-common:${maven.version}'
----

== Basic concepts

_Authentication_ means verifying the identity of a user.

_Authorization_ means verifying a user is authorized to perform a specific task

To support many models and keep things very flexible, all authorization operations are performed on the type
{@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.Authorization}.

In some case, an authorization might represent a permission, for example the authorization to access all printers,
or a specific printer. In others cases, an authorization might be a role (ie: `admin', 'manager', etc.)
In order to provide a small set of implementation the following factories
are available:

* {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.RoleBasedAuthorization} Role based authorization.
* {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.PermissionBasedAuthorization} Permission based authorization.
* {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.WildcardPermissionBasedAuthorization} Role based authorization matched as a wildcard.
* {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.AndAuthorization} Logical authorization.
* {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.OrAuthorization} Logical authorization.
* {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.NotAuthorization} Logical authorization.

This set of authorizations represent any kind of authorization such as:

* Role based authorization
* Permission based authorization
* Logical authorization (AND, OR, NOT)
* Time based authorization (ie: allow access the last 5 days of the month, from 8am till 10am, etc.)
* Context based authorization (ie: allow access if the ip address is 'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx')
* Custom based authorization (ie: based on a script or hard-coded code specific to an application)
* etc...

To find out what a particular {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.AuthorizationProvider} expects, consult the documentation for that auth provider.

== Authentication

To authenticate a user you use {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authentication.AuthenticationProvider#authenticate(io.vertx.core.json.JsonObject, io.vertx.core.Handler)}.

The first argument is a JSON object which contains authentication information. What this actually contains depends
on the specific implementation; for a simple username/password based authentication it might contain something like:

----
{
  "username": "tim"
  "password": "mypassword"
}
----

For an implementation based on JWT token or OAuth bearer tokens it might contain the token information.

Authentication occurs asynchronously and the result is passed to the user on the result handler that was provided in
the call. The async result contains an instance of {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.User} which represents the authenticated
user.

The authentication user object has no context or information on which authorizations the object is entitled. The reason
why authorization and authentication are decoupled is because, authentication and authorization are two distinguished
operations that are not required to be performed on the same provider. A simple example would be, a user authenticating
with plain `OAuth2.0` can use a `JWT` authorization provider to match the token for a given authority, or any other
scenario such as authenticating using `LDAP` and perform authorization using `MongoDB`.

Here's an example of authenticating a user using a simple username/password implementation:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthCommonExamples#example1}
----

== Authorization

Once you have an {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.User} instance you can call {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.User#authorizations} to get its authorizations. A newly created
user will contain no authorizations. You can directly add authorization on the {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.User} itself or via an {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.AuthorizationProvider}.

The results of all the above are provided asynchronously in the handler.

Here's an example adding authorizations via an {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.AuthorizationProvider}:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthCommonExamples#example2}
----

And another example of authorizing in a roles based model which uses the the interface {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.RoleBasedAuthorization}.

Please note, as discussed above how the authority string is interpreted is completely determined by the underlying
implementation and Vert.x makes no assumptions here.

=== Listing authorizations

The user object holds a list of authorizations so subsequently calls should check if it has the same authorizations and it
will result in avoiding one more IO operation to the underlying authorization provider to load the authorizations.

In order to clear the list of authorizations you can use {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.Authorizations#clear()}.

=== The User Principal

You can get the Principal corresponding to the authenticated user with {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.User#principal()}.

What this returns depends on the underlying implementation.

== Creating your own authentication or authorization provider implementation

If you wish to create your own auth provider you should implement the one or both of the interfaces:

* {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authentication.AuthenticationProvider}
* {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.AuthorizationProvider}

The user factory can create a {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.User} object with the given `principal` JSON content. Optionally
a second argument `attributes` can be provided to provide extra meta data for later usage. One example are the following
attributes:

* `exp` - Expires at in seconds.
* `iat` - Issued at in seconds.
* `nbf` - Not before in seconds.
* `leeway` - clock drift leeway in seconds.

While the first 3 control how the {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.User#expired()} method will compute the expiration of the
user, the last can be used to allow clock drifting compensation while computing the expiration time.

== Pseudo Random Number Generator

Since Secure Random from java can block during the acquisition of entropy from the system, we provide a simple wrapper
around it that can be used without the danger of blocking the event loop.

By default this PRNG uses a mixed mode, blocking for seeding, non blocking for generating. The PRNG will also reseed
every 5 minutes with 64bits of new entropy. However this can all be configured using the system properties:

* io.vertx.ext.auth.prng.algorithm e.g.: SHA1PRNG
* io.vertx.ext.auth.prng.seed.interval e.g.: 1000 (every second)
* io.vertx.ext.auth.prng.seed.bits e.g.: 128

Most users should not need to configure these values unless if you notice that the performance of your application is
being affected by the PRNG algorithm.

=== Sharing Pseudo Random Number Generator

Since the Pseudo Random Number Generator objects are expensive in resources, they consume system entropy which is a
scarce resource it can be wise to share the PRNG's across all your handlers. In order to do this and to make this
available to all languages supported by Vert.x you should look into the {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.VertxContextPRNG}.

This interface relaxes the lifecycle management of PRNG's for the end user and ensures it can be reused across all
your application, for example:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthCommonExamples#example4}
----

== Working with Keys

When working with security you will face the need to load security keys. There are many formats and standards for
security keys which makes it quite a complex task. In order to simplify the work on the developer side, this module
contains 2 abstractions:

1. {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.KeyStoreOptions} that abstract the JVM keystore common format.
2. {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.PubSecKeyOptions} that abstract the PEM common format.

To load a local keystore modules shall ask for an options object like:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthCommonExamples#example5}
----

The type is quite important as it varies with the JVM version used. Before 9, the default is `jks` which is JVM specific
after it `pkcs12` which is a common standard.

Non JVM keystore keys can be imported to a `pkcs12` file, even without the need of the `keytool` command, for example
this is how it can be done with `OpenSSL`:

----
openssl pkcs12 -export -in mykeycertificate.pem -out mykeystore.pkcs12 -name myAlias -noiter -nomaciter
----

The command above will convert an existing pem file to a pkcs12 keystore and put the given key under the name `myAlias`.
The extra arguments `-noiter -nomaciter` are required in order to make the file compatible with the JVM loader.

To load a `PEM` file you should be aware that there are a few limitations. The default JVM classes only support keys in
`PKCS8` format, so if you have a different PEM file you need to convert it with `OpenSSL` like:

----
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in private.pem -out private_key.pem -nocrypt
----

After this using such file is as trivial as:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthCommonExamples#example6}
----

PEM files are common and easy to use but are not password protected, so private keys can easily be sniffed.

=== JSON Web Keys

JWKs are a standard used by OpenID connect and JWT providers. They represent a key as a JSON object. Usually these JSON
documents are provided by an identity provider server like Google, Microsoft, etc... but you can also generate your own
keys using the online application <a href="https://mkjwk.org/">https://mkjwk.org</a>. For an offline experience there is
also the tool: <a href="https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt/generator">https://connect2id.com/products/nimbus-jose-jwt/generator</a>.

== Chaining authentication providers

There are cases where it might be interesting to have support for chaining authentication providers, for example look up
users on LDAP or properties files. This can be achieved with the {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.ChainAuth}.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthCommonExamples#example7}
----

It is also possible to perform a *all* match, a user must be matched on LDAP and Properties for example:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthCommonExamples#example8}
