== The JWT auth provider

This component contains an out of the box a JWT implementation. To use this project, add the following
dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
  <artifactId>vertx-auth-jwt</artifactId>
  <version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-auth-jwt:${maven.version}'
----

JSON Web Token is a simple way to send information in the clear (usually in a URL) whose contents can be
verified to
be trusted. JWT are well suited for scenarios as:

* In a Single Sign-On scenario where you want a separate authentication server that can then send user
information in a trusted way.
* Stateless API servers, very well suited for single page applications.
* etc...

Before deciding on using JWT, it's important to note that JWT does not encrypt the payload, it only signs it. You
should not send any secret information using JWT, rather you should send information that is not secret but needs to
be verified. For instance, sending a signed user id to indicate the user that should be logged in would work great!
Sending a user's password would be very, very bad.

Its main advantages are:

* It allows you to verify token authenticity.
* It has a json body to contain any variable amount of data you want.
* It's completely stateless.

To create an instance of the provider you use {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.jwt.JWTAuth}. You specify the configuration
in a JSON object.

Here's an example of creating a JWT auth provider:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example6}
----

A typical flow of JWT usage is that in your application you have one end point that issues tokens, this end point
should be running in SSL mode, there after you verify the request user, say by its username and password you would
do:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example7}
----

=== Loading Keys

Loading keys can be performed in 3 different ways:

* Using secrets (symmetric keys)
* Using OpenSSL `pem` formatted files (pub/sec keys)
* Using Java Keystore files (both symmetric and pub/sec keys)

It is recommended to avoid java keystores, as java keystores are complex to generate and make many assumptions in order
to choose the right key for the authenticator.

==== Using Symmetric Keys

The default signature method for JWT's is known as `HS256`. `HS` stands in this case for `HMAC Signature using SHA256`.

This is the simplest key to load. All you need is a secret that is shared between you and the 3rd party, for example
assume that the secret is: `keyboard cat` then you can configure your Auth as:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example16}
----

In this case the secret is configured as a public key, as it is a token that is known to both parties and you configure
your PubSec key as being symmetric.


==== Using RSA keys

This section is by no means a manual on OpenSSL and a read on OpenSSL command line usage is advised. We will cover
how to generate the most common keys and how to use them with JWT auth.

Imagine that you would like to protect your application using the very common `RS256` JWT algorithm. Contrary to some
belief, 256 is not the key length but the hashing algorithm signature length. Any RSA key can be used with this JWT
algorithm. Here is an information table:

[width="80%",cols="e,>s",options="header"]
|=========================================================
|"alg" Param Value |Digital Signature Algorithm

|RS256 |RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-256

|RS384 |RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-384

|RS512 |RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 using SHA-512

|=========================================================

If you would like to generate a 2048bit RSA key pair, then you would do (please remember **not** to add a passphrase
otherwise you will not be able to read the private key in the JWT auth):

----
openssl genrsa -out private.pem 2048
----

You can observe that the key is correct as the file content is similar to this:

----
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEowIBAAKCAQEAxPSbCQY5mBKFDIn1kggvWb4ChjrctqD4nFnJOJk4mpuZ/u3h
...
e4k0yN3F1J1DVlqYWJxaIMzxavQsi9Hz4p2JgyaZMDGB6kGixkMo
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
----

The standard JDK cannot read this file as is, so we **must** convert it to PKCS8 format first:

----
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in private.pem -out private_key.pem -nocrypt
----

Now the new file `private_key.pem` which resembles the original one contains:

----
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQDE9JsJBjmYEoUM
...
0fPinYmDJpkwMYHqQaLGQyg=
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
----

If we are verifying tokens only (you will only need the private_key.pem file) however at some point you will need to
issue tokens too, so you will a public key. In this case you need to extract the public key from the private key file:

----
openssl rsa -in private.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem
----

And you should see that the content of the file is similar to this:

----
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAxPSbCQY5mBKFDIn1kggv
...
qwIDAQAB
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
----

Now you can use this to issue or validate tokens:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example15}
----

Do note that all the lines `-----BEGIN ...` and `-----END...` should be stripped from the string to be passed to the
configuration.

==== Using EC keys

Elliptic Curse keys are also supported, however the default JDK has some limitations on the features that can be used.

The usage is very similar to RSA, first you create a private key:

----
openssl ecparam -name secp256r1 -genkey -out private.pem
----

So you will get something similar to this:

----
-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
BggqhkjOPQMBBw==
-----END EC PARAMETERS-----
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHcCAQEEIMZGaqZDTHL+IzFYEWLIYITXpGzOJuiQxR2VNGheq7ShoAoGCCqGSM49
AwEHoUQDQgAEG1O9LCrP6hg3Y9q68+LF0q48UcOkwVKE1ax0b56wjVusf3qnuFO2
/+XHKKhtzEavvFMeXRQ+ZVEqM0yGNb04qw==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
----

However the JDK prefers PKCS8 format so we must convert:

----
openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -nocrypt -in private.pem -out private_key.pem
----

Which will give you a key similar to this:

----
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
MIGHAgEAMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHBG0wawIBAQQgxkZqpkNMcv4jMVgR
YshghNekbM4m6JDFHZU0aF6rtKGhRANCAAQbU70sKs/qGDdj2rrz4sXSrjxRw6TB
UoTVrHRvnrCNW6x/eqe4U7b/5ccoqG3MRq+8Ux5dFD5lUSozTIY1vTir
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
----

Using the private key you can already generate tokens:

[source,java]
-----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example17}
-----

So in order to validate the tokens you will need a public key:

----
openssl ec -in private.pem -pubout -out public.pem
----

So you can do all operations with it:

[source,java]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example18}
----

==== The JWT keystore file

If you prefer to use Java Keystores, then you can do it either.

This auth provider requires a keystore in the classpath or in the filesystem with either a
`https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/Mac.html[javax.crypto.Mac]`
or a `https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/Signature.html[java.security.Signature]` in order to
sign and verify the generated tokens.

The implementation will, by default, look for the following aliases, however not all are required to be present. As
a good practice `HS256` should be present:
----
`HS256`:: HMAC using SHA-256 hash algorithm
`HS384`:: HMAC using SHA-384 hash algorithm
`HS512`:: HMAC using SHA-512 hash algorithm
`RS256`:: RSASSA using SHA-256 hash algorithm
`RS384`:: RSASSA using SHA-384 hash algorithm
`RS512`:: RSASSA using SHA-512 hash algorithm
`ES256`:: ECDSA using P-256 curve and SHA-256 hash algorithm
`ES384`:: ECDSA using P-384 curve and SHA-384 hash algorithm
`ES512`:: ECDSA using P-521 curve and SHA-512 hash algorithm
----

When no keystore is provided the implementation falls back in unsecure mode and signatures will not be verified, this
is useful for the cases where the payload if signed and or encrypted by external means.

Key pairs stored on a keystore always include a certificate. The validity of the certificate is tested on load and keys
will not be loaded if either expired or not yet valid to be use.

All keys algorithms will be checked if can be matched to the given alias. For example an `RS256` key will not be loaded
if issued with a `EC` algorithm, or if issued with `RSA` but signature `SHA1WithRSA` instead of `SHA256WithRSA`.

===== Generate a new Keystore file

The only required tool to generate a keystore file is `keytool`, you can now specify which algorithms you need by
running:

=== Read only tokens

If you need to consume JWT tokens issues by third parties you probably won't have the private key with you, in that
case all you need to have is a public key im PEM format.

{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example8}

== AuthN/AuthZ with JWT

A common scenario when developing for example micro services is that you want you application to consume APIs. These
api's are not meant to be consumed by humans so we should remove all the interactive part of authenticating the
consumer out of the picture.

In this scenario one can use HTTP as the protocol to consume this API and the HTTP protocol already defines that there
is a header `Authorization` that should be used for passing authorization information. In most cases you will see that
tokens are sent as bearer tokens, i.e.: `Authorization: Bearer some+base64+string`.

=== Authenticating (AuthN)

For this provider a user is authenticated if the token passes the signature checks and that the token is not expired.
For this reason it is imperative that private keys are kept private and not copy pasted across project since it would
be a security hole.

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example9}
----

In a nutshell the provider is checking for several things:

* token signature is valid against internal private key
* fields: `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, `audience`, `issuer` are valid according to the config

If all these are valid then the token is considered good and a user object is returned.

While the fields `exp`, `iat` and `nbf` are simple timestamp checks only `exp` can be configured to be ignored:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example10}
----

In order to verify the `aud` field one needs to pass the options like before:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example11}
----

And the same for the issuer:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example12}
----

=== Authorizing (AuthZ)

Once a token is parsed and is valid we can use it to perform authorization tasks. The most simple is to verify if a
user has a specific authority. In this case one needs to to:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example13}
----

By default the provider will lookup under the key `permissions` but like the other providers one can extend the
concept to authorities to roles by using the `:` as a splitter, so `role:authority` can be used to lookup the token.

Since JWT are quite free form and there is no standard on where to lookup for the claims the location can be
configured to use something else than `permissions`, for example one can even lookup under a path like this:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.AuthJWTExamples#example14}
----

So in this example we configure the JWT to work with Keycloak token format. In this case the claims will be checked
under the path `realm_access/roles` rather than `permissions`.

=== Validating Tokens

When the method `authenticate` is invoked, the token is validated against the `JWTOptions` provided during the
initialization. The validation performs the following steps:

1. if `ignoreExpiration` (default is false) is false then the token is checked for expiration, this will check the
   fields: `exp`, `iat` and `nbf`. Since sometimes clocks are not reliable, it is possible to configure some `leeway`
   to be applied to the dates so we allow some grace period if the dates are outside the required limits.
2. if `audience` is provided, then the token `aud` is checked against the configured one and all configured audiences
   must be in the token.
3. if `issuer` is configured, then the tokens `iss` is checked against the configured one.

Once these validations complete a JWTUser object is then returned, the object is configured with a reference to the
permission claims key provided in the configuration. This value is used later when doing authorization. The value
corresponds to the json path where authorities should be checked.

=== Customizing Token Generation

In the same way tokens are validated, the generation is initially configured during the initialization.

When generating a token an optional extra parameter can be supplied to control the token generation, this is a
`JWTOptions` object. The token signature algorithm (default HS256) can be configured using the property `algorithm`.
In this case a lookup for a key that corresponds to the algorithm is performed and used to sign.

Token headers can be added by specifying any extra headers to be merged with the default ones using the options `headers`
property.

Sometimes it might be useful to issue tokens without a timestamp (test, development time for example) in this case the
property `noTimestamp` should be set to true (default false). This means that there is no `iat` field in the token.

Token expiration is controlled by the property `expiresInSeconds`, by default there is no expiration. Other control
fields `audience`, `issuer` and `subject` are then picked from the config is available and added to the token metadata.

Finally the token is signed and encoded in the correct format.

=== MicroProfile JWT 1.1 spec

Another format in the form of a spec is the MP-JWT 1.1. This spec defines a JSON array of strings under the property
name `groups` that define the "groups" the token has an authority over.

In order to use this spec to assert AuthZ the right handler must be set:
