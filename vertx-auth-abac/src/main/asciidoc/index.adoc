= ABAC Auth Provider

We provide an implementation of {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.AuthorizationProvider} that uses a simple
Attribute Based Access Control. The provider is backed by a Policy object which contains matches of attributes against
the given user, and on match, the listed authorizations will be granted to the user.

Once the provider returns the authorizations for the user, the mechanism for verification is the same as any other
{@link io.vertx.ext.auth.authorization.AuthorizationProvider}.

To use this project, add the following dependency to the _dependencies_ section of your build descriptor:

* Maven (in your `pom.xml`):

[source,xml,subs="+attributes"]
----
<dependency>
<groupId>io.vertx</groupId>
<artifactId>vertx-auth-abac</artifactId>
<version>${maven.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

* Gradle (in your `build.gradle` file):

[source,groovy,subs="+attributes"]
----
compile 'io.vertx:vertx-auth-abac:${maven.version}'
----

To create an instance you first need a policy object.

For example:

[source,json]
----
{
  "name" : "Only MFA users have DELETE rights",
  "attributes" : {
    "/principal/amr": {
      "eq": "mfa"
    }
  },
  "authorizations" : [ {
    "type" : "wildcard",
    "permission" : "web:DELETE"
  } ]
}
----

Once you've got one of these you can create a {@link io.vertx.ext.auth.abac.PolicyBasedAuthorizationProvider} instance
as follows:

[source,$lang]
----
{@link examples.ABACExamples#example1()}
----

You can load a single policy from a file, or by code, and load multiple policies to the provider. When multiple policies
are loaded, all policies are matched against the user, and all authorizations are returned.

Policies make use of attributes, Vert.x only provides a simple attribute implementation for equality, negation or value
in a collection match. Although this is not a limitation, as you can implement your own attribute using composition and
register it with the policy.
