/**
 * Scope is a mechanism in OAuth 2.0 to limit an application's access to a user's account.
 * An application can request one or more scopes, this information is then presented to the
 * user in the consent screen, and the access token issued to the application will be
 * limited to the scopes granted.
 *
 * The OAuth spec allows the authorization server or user to modify the scopes granted to
 * the application compared to what is requested, although there are not many examples of
 * services doing this in practice.
 *
 * OAuth2 does not define any particular values for scopes, since it is highly dependent
 * on the service's internal architecture and needs.
